- Have a checkbox for the search param restricted_attempts that when checked will only allow the specified number of attempts (number of actual numbers in the chords) + 2.
  - If checked, also display the number of attempts left in the upper right corner as a banner.
- Number of attempts should be decreaed each time a key is pressed until it reach 0 in which case, it should stop producing a sound, and then resets when the next song starts
- actually, have the banner be on the lower left instead
- the checkbox text is aligned inconsistently witht he other checkboxes
